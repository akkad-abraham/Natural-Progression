## 1.4.0

### Added

- Compatibility for the new 1.16 Nether Woods -- whoops ðŸ™„
- Compatibility for several modded woods (INFINITELY many thanks to [sargunv's](https://github.com/sargunv-mc-mods/Natural-Progression/tree/data-fixes) data fixes). This includes:

  - Add any tool/item to the tag `natural-progression:override_pickaxes` to bypass the check for a pick

### Fixed

- Plank recipes being removed for ALL machines/recipes. Now they're only removed

### Changed

- Removed `removeAllPlankRecipes` config option -- everything is datapack powered now thanks to [sargunv](https://github.com/sargunv-mc-mods).

**NOTE**: Mod compatability requires you to configure the Natural Progression Built-In Datapack to have higher priority than all the mods you wish for it to affect.
